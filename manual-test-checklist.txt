The following should still work in both GUI and terminal Emacs:

 - Standard meta commands, e.g. M-f, M-g g.
 - C-h k (describe-key) would still work for meta commands.
 - xterm-mouse-mode in terminal, mouse drag selection still work.
 - Commnads that generate longer escape key sequences, e.g. C-right.

Additionally the following new functionality will work with by typing
a single ESC:

 - Quit out of region selection.
 - Quit out of partially typed commands, such as M-g.
 - Quit out of minibuffer.
